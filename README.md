The repository for RePocket Edition (MCRPE) source code.
RePocket Edition is a planned recreation of Minecraft: Pocket Edition Alpha v0.8.0 with some slight liberties and some features from other versions being added. The main feature is that infinite worlds are an option, along with skins, better multiplayer, accounts, servers, minigames that are like the ones from Legacy Console Edition, texture pack support, command blocks, behavior pack/data pack support and mod support.

These features are planned and will be added over time. So far however, the project has just begun.
I also have gotten permission from @Good (the creator of ClassiCube's textures) to use them for this project, as long as I give credit, which I am doing right now.
